 crispy fried onions:

Ingredients:

    2 large onions
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp black pepper
    1 tsp paprika
    1 tsp garlic powder
    1 cup vegetable oil

Instructions:

    Peel the onions and slice them thinly.

    In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.

    Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

    Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture, making sure they are coated evenly.

    Shake off any excess flour and place the coated onions into the hot oil.

    Fry the onions, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy. This should take about 5-7 minutes.

    Use a slotted spoon to remove the onions from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

    Season the crispy onions with additional salt and pepper, if desired, and serve immediately.

Enjoy your crispy fried onions as a topping for burgers, salads, soups, or as a tasty snack!
