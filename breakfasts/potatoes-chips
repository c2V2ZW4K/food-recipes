Para fazer batatas fritas sequinhas e crocantes com as batatas do seu quintal, siga os passos abaixo:

Ingredients:

    Potatoes from your backyard (about 4 to 6 medium-sized potatoes)
    Vegetable oil for frying
    Salt to taste

Instructions:

1) Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized sticks.
2) Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. This will help remove excess starch and prevent the potatoes from becoming limp.
3) After 30 minutes, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a clean towel or paper towels.
4) Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot that is large enough to hold the potatoes without too much overlap. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 180Â°C.
5) Add the dried potatoes to the hot oil in small batches. Do not overcrowd the pot with too many potatoes at once, as this will cause them to become limp and not crispy.
6) Fry the potatoes for about 5 to 7 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir the potatoes occasionally with a slotted spoon to ensure that they cook evenly.
7) Remove the French fries from the pot with a slotted spoon and let them drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
8) Sprinkle salt over the French fries and serve while still hot.

Enjoy your delicious crispy and dry French fries made with potatoes from your own backyard just like the ones sold in the market!
