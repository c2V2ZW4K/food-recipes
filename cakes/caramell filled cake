the recipe for caramel-filled cake:

Ingredients:

    2 cups of sugar
    1 cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature
    4 eggs
    1 tablespoon of vanilla extract
    3 cups of all-purpose flour
    1 tablespoon of baking powder
    1 teaspoon of baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon of salt
    1 and 1/2 cups of milk
    1 cup of brown sugar
    1/2 cup of heavy cream
    1/4 cup of water
    1/2 cup of unsalted butter

Instructions:

1) Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2) In a large bowl, beat the sugar and butter until the mixture is light and fluffy.
3) Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
4) Mix in the vanilla extract.
5) In another bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
6) Add the flour mixture to the sugar and egg mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix well after each addition.
7) Pour the mixture into a greased and floured cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
8) While the cake is baking, prepare the caramel filling. In a medium saucepan, mix the brown sugar, heavy cream, water, and unsalted butter. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Continue to cook for a few more minutes until the caramel thickens and turns golden. Remove from heat and let cool for a bit.
9) Cut the cake in half and spread half of the caramel filling on top of one half. Place the other half of the cake on top and cover with the remaining caramel filling.
10) Serve at room temperature and enjoy!
