Here's a simple recipe for a quick cake using Nescau (a brand of chocolate powder) and Maizena (cornstarch):

Ingredients:

    1 cup of Nescau
    1 cup of Maizena
    1/5 cup of sugar
    1 cup of milk
    3 eggs
    1 tablespoon of baking powder
    1/2 cup of vegetable oil

Instructions:

    Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
    In a large mixing bowl, mix together the Nescau, Maizena, sugar, and baking powder.
    Add the milk, eggs, and vegetable oil to the bowl and mix everything together until you have a smooth batter.
    Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.
    Bake for around 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
    Allow the cake to cool before serving.
