Easy Donut Recipe

Ingredients:

    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 cup sugar
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    3/4 cup milk
    2 eggs
    2 tablespoons melted butter
    Oil for frying
    Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

Instructions:

1) In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2) In another bowl, mix together milk, eggs, and melted butter.
3) Add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture and mix until smooth.
4) Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it's about 1.5 cm thick.
5) Use a donut cutter (or a large cup and a smaller cutter to make the hole in the middle) to cut the dough into donut shapes.
6) Heat oil in a pan until it's hot enough for frying (around 170-180Â°C).
7) Fry the donuts until they're golden brown, about 1-2 minutes on each side.
8) Remove the donuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
9) If desired, dust the donuts with powdered sugar before serving.

There you have it! Now you have homemade and delicious donuts to enjoy.
