recipe for very delicious donuts:

Ingredients:

    3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup granulated sugar
    1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
    2 large eggs
    2/3 cup whole milk
    2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
    Oil for frying

For the glaze:

    2 cups powdered sugar
    1/4 cup whole milk
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

1) In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and nutmeg.
2) In another bowl, beat the eggs and then stir in the milk and softened butter.
3) Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.
4) Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.
5) Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.
6) After the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thickness.
7) Use a donut cutter (or a large biscuit cutter and a small round cutter for the center) to cut out the donuts.
8) Heat oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 350°F (180°C).
9) Fry the donuts in batches, flipping them once, until they are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.
10) Remove the donuts with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess oil.
11) For the glaze, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a small bowl until smooth.
12) Dip each donut into the glaze and place it back on the plate to dry.

Enjoy your delicious homemade donuts!
